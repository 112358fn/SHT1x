Provides a simple interface to the SHT1x series (SHT10, SHT11, SHT15)
temperature / humidity sensors from Sensirion (www.sensirion.com).
These sensors use a "2-wire" communications buss that is similar to I2C
and can co-exist on the same physical wire as I2C devices, but is not
directly interoperable with it.
